System Assumptions 
1. Organizational Assumptions  
1. University / Institution Exists 
  
● The system is built for one institution 
● Multi-university support is out of scope 
● All data belongs to a single academic organization 
● Your schema does not have a university_id or tenant_id 
  
Reason: Schema design indicates single-tenant architecture. 
  
2. Academic Structure Is Well-Defined 
  
● Branches (CSE, ECE, etc.) exist 
● Semesters are predefined 
● Sections belong to a branch + semester 
  
Reason: Students, subjects, exams, timetable, and attendance all depend on this hierarchy. 
  
2. User & Role Assumptions 
3. Roles Are Fixed and Finite 
  
● Only three roles exist: ADMIN, TEACHER, STUDENT 
● No dynamic or custom roles 
  
Reason: RBAC logic and APIs are hard-coded around these roles. 
  

Critical assumption 
  
4. At Least One Admin Exists Before System Use 
  
● First admin is created via DB seed script OR secure bootstrap process 
● No public signup for admin 
  
Reason: Without an admin, no configuration can happen. 
  
5. Admins Do Not Manage Other Admins (by design) 
  
● Admins manage only: Students, Teachers 
● Admin visibility into other admins is restricted 
  
Reason: Security and privilege isolation. 
  
3. Data Integrity Assumptions 
6. Email Is Unique Across All Users 
  
● No two users share the same email 
● Email is the login identifier 
  
Reason: Authentication depends on unique email lookup. 
  
7. Users Are Soft-Deleted, Not Hard-Deleted 
  
● Users are deactivated via is_active 
● Historical data (attendance, marks) remains intact 
  
Reason: Attendance, exams, and results depend on historical users. 
  
8. A Student Belongs to Only One Section at a Time 

  
● No multi-section enrollment 
● Section changes happen administratively 
  
Reason: Attendance and timetable logic assume one section per student. 
  
4. Academic Flow Assumptions 
9. Teacher Authority Is Explicitly Assigned 
  
● Teachers cannot mark attendance, enter marks, or approve leaves unless assigned via 
Teacher Assignment 
  
Reason: TEACHER_ASSIGNMENTS is the authority source. 
  
10. Subjects Belong to One Branch + Semester 
  
● A subject cannot span multiple branches or semesters 
  
Reason: Timetable, exams, and electives depend on this mapping. 
  
11. Electives Are Chosen Explicitly by Students 
  
● Elective subjects are created by admin 
● Elective subjects are selected by students 
● Core subjects apply to all students in a section 
  
Reason: Attendance and exams are filtered using STUDENT_ELECTIVES. 
  
5. Attendance & Exam Assumptions 
12. Attendance Is Marked Once Per Subject Per Day 
  
● One attendance record per: Student, Subject, Date 

  
Reason: Prevents duplicate attendance entries. 
  
13. Exams Are Section + Subject Specific 
  
● An exam belongs to one subject and one section 
● No cross-section exams 
  
Reason: Marks and approval workflow rely on this. 
  
14. Exam Marks Require Admin Approval 
  
● Teacher submits marks 
● Admin approves 
● Students see results only after approval 
  
Reason: Prevents unauthorized or premature result exposure. 
  
6. Leave & Notification Assumptions 
15. Leave Approval Is Teacher-Driven 
  
● Student applies for leave 
● Assigned teacher reviews it 
● Admin sees summary only 
  
Reason: Teacher is closest authority to students. 
  
16. Notifications Are Per-User, Not Broadcast Rows 
  
● A notification row exists per recipient 
● Broadcast = multiple inserts 
  

Reason: Your NOTIFICATIONS table has user_id. 
  
7. Security & Access Assumptions 
17. Backend Enforces RBAC (Not UI) 
  
● Frontend hides buttons 
● Backend always validates role & ownership 
  
Reason: UI alone cannot be trusted. 
  
18. JWT Is Required for Every Protected API 
  
● Token contains: user_id, role 
● Token is validated on every request 
  
Reason: Stateless, secure access control. 
  
8. Operational Assumptions 
19. CSV Imports Are Clean and Validated 
  
● Admin uploads correct CSV format 
● Backend validates each row 
● Partial success is allowed 
  
Reason: Batch operations must not corrupt data. 
  
20. System Is Used in Normal Academic Scale 
  
● Thousands of students 
● Hundreds of teachers 
● Not millions 
  

Reason: Query patterns and pagination assume this scale. 
  
9. Chatbot-Specific Assumptions 
21. Chatbot Is Read-Only 
  
● Chatbot does NOT: Create, Update, or Delete data 
● Only queries existing data 
  
Reason: Safety and data integrity. 
  
22. Chatbot Respects RBAC Automatically 
  
● Admin → system-wide data 
● Teacher → assigned scope 
● Student → own data 
  
Reason: Chatbot uses same permission layer as APIs.

Overall Solutioning 
The proposed solution is a role-based School Management System designed to digitize and 
streamline core academic and administrative workflows defined in the PRD. The system 
focuses on clarity, minimalism, and correctness by ensuring that every feature, screen, API, 
and database table directly supports an in-scope requirement. 
  
The solution is built around three primary user roles: Admin, Teacher, and Student. Each role 
has clearly defined responsibilities and access boundaries, ensuring secure and controlled 
interaction with the system. Role-based access control is enforced consistently across the 
backend APIs and frontend user interface to prevent unauthorized actions and data exposure. 
  
At a high level, the admin acts as the system configurator and controller. Admin users are 
responsible for setting up academic structures (classes, subjects), onboarding students and 
teachers, assigning teachers to classes and subjects, creating timetables and exams, reviewing 
teacher-submitted marks, publishing results, and broadcasting announcements. This central 
control ensures data consistency and institutional oversight. 
  
The Teacher role is designed around daily academic operations. Teachers can view their 
assigned timetables, mark attendance for their classes, enter exam marks, submit marks for 
approval, approve or reject student leave requests, and receive system notifications. Teachers 
are strictly restricted to data and actions related only to their assigned classes and subjects, as 
mandated by the PRD. 

  
The student role is primarily read-only with limited controlled actions. Students can view 
their timetables, attendance records, exam schedules, and published results. They can also 
apply for leave and track its approval status, as well as receive announcements and 
notifications. Students can access only their own academic data, ensuring privacy and 
security. 
  
From a data perspective, the system uses a normalized PostgreSQL schema with carefully 
chosen tables that avoid redundancy. A single user's table supports all roles, while operational 
tables such as attendance, exams, marks, leaves, timetables, and notifications capture 
academic activities. Derived data like results and performance metrics are computed 
dynamically from stored records instead of being redundantly persisted, keeping the data 
model simple and consistent. 
  
The backend, implemented using FastAPI, serves as the single source of truth. It enforces all 
validations, business rules, and access checks defined in the PRD. RESTful APIs are grouped 
by role and responsibility, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and easy maintainability. 
Critical operations are wrapped in database transactions to maintain data integrity. 
  
The frontend, built as a React Single Page Application, provides a clean and responsive user 
experience. Role-based dashboards and minimal screens ensure usability without 
overwhelming users. Reusable components and read-only overlays are used to reduce 
unnecessary navigation and complexity. Every screen maps directly to backend APIs, 
ensuring there is no unsupported or redundant UI. 
  
Overall, the solution delivers a cohesive, secure, and scalable academic management platform 
that strictly adheres to the PRD, avoids over-engineering, and provides a clear, maintainable 
foundation for future enhancements. 
  
 
  
Implementation Approach 
Overall Architecture 
The system follows a role-based, modular, client-server architecture aligned with the PRD 
requirements. 
  
Frontend: 
  

A Single Page Application (SPA) developed using JavaScript (React) to provide a responsive 
and role-based user interface. 
  
Backend: 
  
A set of RESTful APIs implemented using FastAPI, responsible for handling business logic, 
validations, and access control. 
  
Database: 
  
PostgreSQL is used as the primary relational database for storing all academic and 
operational data. 
  
Authentication: 
  
JWT-based authentication is used along with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). 
  
The frontend communicates with the backend exclusively through REST APIs. 
  
The backend acts as the single source of truth and enforces all business rules defined in the 
PRD. 
  
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
The system supports the following roles defined in the PRD: 
  
● Admin 
● Teacher 
● Student 
  
RBAC is enforced at two levels. 
  
Backend Level 
  

● Each API endpoint is protected using JWT authentication. 
● Role information is embedded inside the JWT token. 
  
Middleware validates: 
  
● Authentication (valid token) 
● Authorization (role-based access) 
  
Examples: 
  
● Only Admin users can access /admin/* APIs. 
● Teachers cannot access admin configuration APIs. 
● Students can only fetch their own data. 
  
Frontend Level 
  
● UI screens are conditionally rendered based on the logged-in user's role. 
● Users only see screens relevant to their responsibilities. 
● Unauthorized navigation is blocked at the routing level. 
  
Authentication & Security Approach 
Authentication Flow 
  
● The user logs in using email and password. 
● The backend validates credentials against the users table. 
  
On successful validation: 
  
● A JWT token is generated. 
● User ID and role are embedded inside the token. 
● The token is returned to the frontend and stored securely. 
● All subsequent API requests include the JWT token. 
  

Password Security 
  
● Passwords are never stored in plain text. 
● Passwords are hashed using industry-standard hashing algorithms. 
● First-time login enforces a password change using the is_first_login flag. 
  
Session Management 
  
● Stateless authentication is implemented using JWT. 
● Logout is handled via a POST API that invalidates the session or token. 
  
Frontend Implementation Strategy 
UI Design 
  
● Role-based dashboards are provided for Admin, Teacher, and Student users. 
● The number of screens is kept minimal as specified in the PRD. 
● Reusable UI components are used for tables, forms, modals, and notifications. 
  
Screen-to-API Mapping 
  
● Each screen maps directly to one or more backend APIs. 
● No screen exists without backend support. 
● Read-only overlays are used instead of creating unnecessary screens, reducing UI 
complexity. 
  
State Management 
  
● Local state is used for form handling and UI interactions. 
● A centralized API service layer is used for backend communication. 
● Proper loading, error, and empty states are handled across all screens. 
  
Backend Implementation Strategy 
API Design 

  
RESTful APIs are grouped by role: 
  
● /auth/* 
● /admin/* 
● /teacher/* 
● /student/* 
  
A clear separation of concerns is maintained between: 
  
● Controllers 
● Validation 
● Business Logic 
● Database Access 
  
Business Logic Handling 
  
All validations are enforced at the backend, including: 
  
● Role validation 
● Teacher-class-subject assignment checks 
● Exam publishing rules 
● Attendance marking rules 
  
Derived data such as results, percentages, and rankings are computed dynamically from 
stored records to avoid redundant storage. 
  
Error Handling 
  
● Standardized error responses are used. 
● Meaningful HTTP status codes are returned. 
● Validation errors are clearly communicated to the frontend. 
  
Database Interaction Approach 

Schema Usage 
  
● PostgreSQL is used with a normalized schema. 
● Relationships are enforced using foreign key constraints. 
● No redundant or unused tables exist. 
  
Key Design Decisions 
  
● A single users table is used for all roles. 
● No separate results table is maintained; results are computed from marks. 
● Notifications are stored in a single unified table. 
● Soft-delete logic is implemented using active or status flags where required. 
  
Transactions 
  
Critical operations such as student creation, exam publishing, and marks approval are handled 
using database transactions to ensure data consistency. 
  
Notifications Handling 
● Notifications are stored in a unified notifications table. 
  
They are used for: 
  
● System announcements 
● Leave status updates 
● Exam and result publishing 
● Users fetch notifications via role-specific APIs. 
● Read and unread states are managed using flags. 
● No separate email logging table is maintained, keeping the design strictly aligned with the 
PRD. 
  
Scalability & Maintainability 
Scalability 

  
● The stateless backend design supports horizontal scaling. 
● There is a clear separation between frontend and backend layers. 
● The database schema supports growth in users, classes, and academic records. 
  
Maintainability 
  
● A modular code structure is followed on both frontend and backend. 
● API contracts are clear and well-defined. 
● Role-based separation reduces coupling between modules. 
● The system can be easily extended with additional features in the future without redesign. 
  
Non-Functional Requirements Alignment 
● Security: JWT authentication, role checks, hashed passwords 
● Performance: Optimized database queries and pagination 
● Maintainability: Modular architecture and clean separation of concerns 
● Usability: Role-specific and minimal user interface 
● Reliability: Use of database transactions and validations 
  
This approach improves maintainability, scalability, and ease of testing.

Database Schema Design 
The database is designed as a centralized relational system using PostgreSQL and acts as the 
single source of truth. It is optimized to remain simple while still covering all in-scope 
requirements from the PRD. 
  
Key design principles: 
  
● Strong relationships using foreign keys 
● Role-based access enforced via mappings 
● Soft deletes using is_active flags 
● Audit fields for traceability 
  
The core tables include: 
  
● Users 
● Branches 
● Subjects 
● Semester 
● Section 
● Teacher Assignments 
● Attendance 
● Notification 

● Leave Application 
● Timetable 
● Exam Marks 
● Exam 
● Student_Elective
